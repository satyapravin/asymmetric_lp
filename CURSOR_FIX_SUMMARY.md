# Cursor Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Cursor environment was not working due to missing dependencies and configuration issues in the remote development environment.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Docker**: Docker was not installed, preventing containerized development
2. **Python Environment Issues**: 
   - No virtual environment set up
   - Incompatible package versions for Python 3.13
   - Missing build dependencies for some packages
3. **Development Tools**: While basic tools were available, the environment needed proper setup

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Docker Installation
- Installed Docker CE using the official installation script
- Configured Docker daemon to run manually (systemd not available in this environment)
- Set up proper permissions for Docker socket

### ✅ 2. Python Environment Setup
- Created Python virtual environment in `/workspace/python/venv/`
- Updated `requirements.txt` to use Python 3.13 compatible versions:
  - `uniswap-python==0.7.1` (was 1.0.0 - not available)
  - `pandas>=2.2.0` (was 2.1.4 - incompatible with Python 3.13)
  - `numpy>=1.26.0` (was 1.24.3 - incompatible with Python 3.13)
- Successfully installed core packages: pandas, numpy, requests, python-dotenv

### ✅ 3. Build Tools Verification
- Confirmed CMake 3.31.6 is available
- Confirmed GCC 14.2.0 is available
- C++ development environment is ready

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Python Environment**: Virtual environment with core packages installed
- **C++ Build Tools**: CMake and GCC ready for compilation
- **Project Structure**: Complete asymmetric liquidity provision strategy codebase
- **Git Repository**: Clean working tree on branch `cursor/fix-non-working-cursor-d8a9`

### ⚠️ Partial Status
- **Docker**: Installed but requires manual daemon management (no systemd)
- **Python Packages**: Core packages working, some optional packages may need individual installation

### 📋 Next Steps for Full Functionality
1. **For Docker Development**:
   ```bash
   sudo dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **For Python Development**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/python
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Add any missing packages individually
   ```

3. **For C++ Development**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/cpp
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

## Project Overview
This is a sophisticated **Asymmetric Liquidity Provision Strategy** that combines:
- **DeFi Component (Python)**: Uniswap V3 liquidity provision with asymmetric ranges
- **CeFi Component (C++)**: Multi-process market making architecture
- **Integration**: ZMQ-based communication between components

The environment is now ready for development work on this quantitative trading strategy.
